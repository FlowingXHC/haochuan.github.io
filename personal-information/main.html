        <p>Hi, my name is Haochuan XIE, my student number is s3939794 and my student email address is s3939794@student.rmit.edu.au, I came from China and Chinese is my first language. I am a student of Bachelor of Information Technology. I have many outdoor hobbies and I love photography, so all the images you saw on this website are shot by myself. A funny thing about my experience of photography is in the beginning, I always used iso 100 to take my pictures, I believe that iso 100 can give me a purer image, but that gives me the most is a dark image that I have to use Photoshop to increase the exposure, which gives me more noisy point, when I overcome the challenge of iso 100, my pictures are getting much better and pure.</p>
