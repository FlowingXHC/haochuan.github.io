        <p>I am planning to develop a smartphone APP called “easy use”, “easy use” will mixes many shortcuts of other apps, it will allow putting their common app in, and it will help people to do their regular job of each day, such as clock in or receive other apps rewards. It is mainly designed for the elder, to optimize their experience of using a smartphone or let them able to use a smartphone, therefore, the “easy use” will be using large font and a colourful graphical interface, which allow them to remember each APP’s colour if they still can’t see. Also, I am planning to use multiple pages ordered by capital letter or custom instead of scroll page, in case people don’t know where are they at, the easier the best, I will design this APP in their most familiar way.</p>

            The motivation of design “easy use” is come from my grandparents, as soon as I moved to Australia, they start to learn how to use WeChat and how to use video call, my grandmother can learn that easily, but my grandfather cannot see very much because of presbyopia, so he can’t call us at any time he wants and he needs to ask my grandmother for help, which makes that not so convenient. And both of them can’t use message very well, because there are many advertisings messages and junk messages, they cannot easily recognize which message is useful to add on the classification of message is not that clear, so they always made some mistake on that. Those are the two main motivations for me to design this APP. I am sure that there will be many elder people who need this APP.

            “Easy use” is designed for the elders, so it will be very easy to use, a colourful graphical interface will be contained, let people be able to remember the colour of icons even they cannot see the word on it, I will be also using large font word so that people can easily read. The operating mode of this APP will be very simple and straight forward, It will be designed step by step, as the image shows, for example, If people want to use WeChat’s video call to call someone, then they will click on WeChat first, then a list of name will appeal, after people find the person they want to call, two huge options will appear in front of them, they can do either video call or phone call by WeChat, The operating mode is similar with WeChat, but what I planed is to let user decide and user will have all the power in this APP, once they have putted someone in the first place at the first page, that name will remain there, it won’t change by a single new message from others, then user won’t need to find that person in a group of people, even user only have a small social circle with a few connections, they still need to find for that people, what I will do is to minimize those things might confuse users, to have a better and familiar experience, just like at the old days using the telephone directory, I saw my grandfather can find the number he want in telephone directory with a few second, but he cannot even find the name of that person in WeChat, so my goal is to design a APP that they will be comfortable to use. I am planning to use multiple pages ordered by capital letter or custom instead of scroll page, in case people don’t know where are they at, the easier the best, or I will just use numbers to order them, I will do more search on that, to see which type do they prefer, I will also add a huge “Back” button, I saw they have always wondering how to get back when they are using other APPs, I won’t contain a single gestures operation, all they need to do is click on the big button, this should make the experience much better. For messages, I will use the same design as the WeChat page, but that part won’t appear all the messages come to the phone, I will give them an option to set the numbers they want to receive, so they can only receive the important message in the “easy use”, they can put such as family number/bank message/friends number in so they will only see those message, and when family numbers that can use a smartphone come to them, they can check the rest of the messages for them.

            I will be using Python to design this APP, I think I will be also using Photoshop to do the icon part, I will be using the tools that I am familiar with, to try to make the program that I am thinking, I will also learn how to make this program by learning some other courses, such as I will learn more about python in Scrimba, I will try to find some examples in Github, but I won’t copy and paste that, I will only use that for an idea.

            This will require the skill of using Python/Photoshop, a few smartphones, and the skills of writing smartphone APPs, it’s not that hard to find those resources to learn, I can try to find some examples in Github.

    <div class="gap"></div>
    <div class="para">
        <p>
            If the project is successful, then my grandfather can call me with WeChat video call very easily, both of my grandparents can read the important message easily, and after they can read the messages, especially bank messages, then they won’t need to walk to bank constantly, they will know what happened wailed they stay at home and looking at their smartphones. The original problem will be solved and elders can feel the convenience of this new age.
